/**
 * In Node.js with Express, express.Router() is used to create modular, mountable route handlers.
 * It helps you split your API or web app into smaller, maintainable pieces instead of writing all routes in one big app.js file.
 * 
 * ðŸ”¹ Why use express.Router()?
 * 1. Modularity â€“ Organize routes by feature (e.g., /users, /products, /orders).
 * 2. Reusability â€“ You can export routers and plug them into different apps or microservices.
 * 3. Middleware Scoping â€“ You can attach middleware to a router, and it will only apply to that router.
 * 4. Cleaner Code â€“ Keeps your app.js (main file) lightweight.
